I dedicate this work for all those who helped me to get this far. My family, my professors, friends, everyone. It's been a long journey. Sometimes I felt like I was in the dark, alone... with an unsurmountable amount of work to do like several others daily workers. Still, I thrived.
One of my main drivers to get this far were my two kids, Isadora and Guilherme. Lead by example is hard...
