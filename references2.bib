abstract = {Context
A microservice architecture is composed of a set of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Many aspects on architecting with microservices are still unexplored and existing research is still far from being crispy clear.
Objective
We aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the art on architecting with microservices from the following perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption.
Method
We apply the systematic mapping methodology. We rigorously selected 103 primary studies and we defined and applied a classification framework to them for extracting key information for subsequent analysis. We synthesized the obtained data and produced a clear overview of the state of the art.
Results
This work contributes with (i) a classification framework for research studies on architecting with microservices, (ii) a systematic map of current research of the field, (iii) an evaluation of the potential for industrial adoption of research results, and (iv) a discussion of emerging findings and implications for future research.
Conclusion
This study provides a solid, rigorous, and replicable picture of the state of the art on architecting with microservices. Its results can benefit both researchers and practitioners of the field.}

	science of design, this new edition of Herbert Simon's classic work	on artificial intelligence adds a chapter that sorts out the current themes and tools---chaos, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms---for
	analyzing complexity and complex systems.
	There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design
	while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter "Economic Reality" has also been revised to reflect
	a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems.},
