\section{Cloud-Native}
\label{sec:cna}
The definition of the cloud-native term is usually related to something built on the cloud, rather than being on-premise \cite{gannon_2017}. However, this definition is incomplete, as cloud-native refers to the software method of creating, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments \cite{aws_2025}. Therefore, it is possible to host cloud-native applications (CNAs) both in the cloud and on-premises, where both styles are sometimes used simultaneously.

The growth of microservices architecture, in conjunction with this model of hosting applications, has introduced a new level of complexity in analyzing problems within the underlying infrastructure. Where organizations once relied on centralized, monolithic systems, modern environments feature distributed frameworks characterized by containerized workloads, independently deployable microservices, and multi-cloud infrastructure arrangements \cite{bhatia_2025}.
