This chapter outlines the methodological framework adopted to conduct this research. Given the nature of this study—which aims not only to explain a phenomenon but to create a solution (artifact) for a practical problem in Kubernetes environments—we adopt the Design Science Research (DSR) approach. DSR is an epistemological-methodological approach that allows for rigorous scientific research linked to the development of computational artifacts \cite{pimentel_2020}. It is especially suitable for complex and ill-defined problems, also defined as wicked problems \cite{marshall_2008}, that require innovative solutions \cite{hevner_2004}.

To demonstrate the suitability of this research method to this work, in the following sections, we will explain the details of how the DSR is characterized as a methodology applied to the field of information systems and the DSRM as an applicable research method.
