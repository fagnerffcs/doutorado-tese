\section{Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM)}
\label{sec:dsrm-process}

To ensure methodological rigor, we follow the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) process model proposed by \citeonline{peffers_2006}, which is structured in six sequential steps. As described by \cite{pimentel_2020}, DSRM method has been consolidated as a popular research method since 2018. Table \ref{tab:dsrm-mapping} maps these steps to the structure of this thesis.
