\section{Metrics and Measurement}
\label{sec:metrics}

To quantify the results of the four scenarios, we utilize two categories of metrics: \textit{Performance Metrics} (for overhead) and \textit{Operational Metrics} (for diagnosis).

\subsection{Resource Consumption Metrics (Overhead)}
These metrics are collected during Scenarios 1 and 2 to test Hypothesis 2 ($H_{1b}$).

\subsection{Diagnostic Metrics (Efficiency)}
These metrics are collected during Scenarios 3 and 4 to test Hypothesis 1 ($H_{1a}$).
