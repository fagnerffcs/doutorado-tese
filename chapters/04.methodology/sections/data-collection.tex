\section{Data Collection and Analysis Tools}
\label{sec:data-collection}

The data collection process is automated to ensure reproducibility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instrumentation:} The \textit{kube-prometheus-stack} is used to scrape internal metrics of the cluster for the overhead analysis.
    \item \textbf{Fault Injection:} \textbf{Chaos Mesh} is configured with distinct experiments (NetworkChaos, PodChaos) defined as YAML manifests.
    \item \textbf{Load Generation:} To simulate traffic during chaos experiments, we utilize \textbf{k6}, ensuring the system is processing requests when faults occur.
\end{itemize}

Comparative analysis will be performed using statistical difference tests (e.g., T-Test) to validate if the differences in MTTD and Overhead are statistically significant.
