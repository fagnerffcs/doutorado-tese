\section{Cloud Context in this Work}
\label{sec:cloud-context}

The implementation of a robust observability architecture is intrinsically linked to the underlying computing paradigm. Before addressing specific orchestration tools like Kubernetes, it is necessary to establish the architectural boundaries and operational constraints within which this research operates.

Cloud computing is not a monolithic concept; it presents a spectrum of abstractions that trade control for convenience. In this section, we delineate the fundamental Service Models defined by the literature, explicitly justifying the adoption of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model for this thesis. This choice is critical as it grants the necessary access to low-level components (such as the kernel and network interfaces) required for deep instrumentation. Furthermore, exploring the Cloud-Native paradigm involves analyzing how its principles of immutability and distribution introduce the very complexity that necessitates the observability solutions proposed in later chapters.
