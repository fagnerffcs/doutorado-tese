\chapter{CLOUD COMPUTING}
\label{chap:cloud-computing}

The transition from monolithic systems to cloud-native paradigms \cite{gannon_2017} serves as the primary catalyst for the observability challenges discussed in the previous chapter. Ideally, Cloud Computing is not just a deployment target but a dynamic operational model characterized by elasticity, on-demand self-service, and resource pooling \cite{mell_grance_2011}. However, these characteristics introduce distinct layers of abstraction and transience that obscure system behavior \cite{jamshidi_2018}. To properly contextualize the environment in which the PANOPTES architecture operates, this chapter establishes the theoretical foundations of Cloud-Native computing. It examines the pivotal role of Kubernetes as the \textit{de facto} operating system for the cloud \cite{luksa_2018, burns_2016} and analyzes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as the mechanism for managing this complexity \cite{morris_2016}. Understanding these components is a prerequisite to addressing the research questions regarding fault diagnosis and architectural integration.
