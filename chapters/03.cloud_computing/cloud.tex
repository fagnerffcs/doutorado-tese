\chapter{CLOUD COMPUTING}
\label{chap:cloud-computing}

The transition from monolithic systems to cloud-native paradigms \cite{gannon_2017} serves as the primary catalyst for the observability challenges discussed in the previous chapter. Ideally, Cloud Computing is not just a deployment target but a dynamic operational model characterized by elasticity, on-demand self-service, and resource pooling \cite{mell_grance_2011}. However, these characteristics introduce distinct layers of abstraction and transience that obscure system behavior \cite{jamshidi_2018}. To properly contextualize the environment in which the PANOPTES architecture operates, this chapter establishes the theoretical foundations of Cloud-Native computing. It examines the pivotal role of Kubernetes as the \textit{de facto} operating system for the cloud \cite{luksa_2018, burns_2016} and analyzes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as the mechanism for managing this complexity \cite{morris_2016}. Understanding these components is a prerequisite to addressing the research questions regarding fault diagnosis and architectural integration.

\section{Cloud-Native}
\label{sec:cna}
The definition of the cloud-native term is usually related to something built in the cloud, rather than on-premises \cite{gannon_2017}. However, this definition is incomplete, as cloud-native refers to the software method of creating, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments \cite{aws_2025}. Therefore, it is possible to host cloud-native applications (CNAs) both in the cloud and on-premises, where both styles are sometimes used simultaneously.

The growth of microservices architecture, in conjunction with this model of hosting applications, has introduced a new level of complexity in analyzing problems within the underlying infrastructure. Where organizations once relied on centralized, monolithic systems, modern environments feature distributed frameworks characterized by containerized workloads, independently deployable microservices, and multi-cloud infrastructure arrangements \cite{bhatia_2025}.
