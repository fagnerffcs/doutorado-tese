\chapter{OBSERVABILITY: A Retrospective across the ages}
\label{chap:observability}

Historically, the concept of observability originated outside of software engineering and has undergone a significant evolutionary path, passing through traditional control and monitoring theory to become a fundamental pillar of modern distributed systems.

The term ``observability'' was coined by engineer Rudolf E. Kalman in 1960, in the context of control theory \cite{flanders_2024, majors_2022}. In its original mathematical definition, observability is a measure of how well the internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs \cite{kalman_1959}.

Initially, this concept belonged to the domain of mechanical engineers and linear physical systems, being studied in these contexts since 1976. Another definition proposed by \cite{songtab_1984}, observability is a fundamental system-theoretic property that reflects the possibility of estimating internal states based on input/output data. Therefore, it is possible to determine the system's operational viability through these external indicators.

However, considering the modern aspects of distributed system environments, the observability concept has evolved through the combination of several indicators, as discussed in the next section.
